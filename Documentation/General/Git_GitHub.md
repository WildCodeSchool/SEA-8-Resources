## Git Commands

### `git init`
### `git clone`
### `git status`
### `git add`
### `git commit`
### `git log`
### `git diff`
### `git remote` 2
### `git push`
### `git fetch`
### `git merge` 3
### `git pull`
### `git branch`
### `git checkout` 
### `git revert`
### `git reset`
### `git stash`
#### **Description**
Stash is a way for you to have a virtual pile of uncommited changes, which is independant from the current branch or working copy of the repo.

From the [official documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash):

> Use `git stash` when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working directory. The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the `HEAD` commit.\
\
The modifications stashed away by this command can be listed with `git stash list`, inspected with `git stash show`, and restored (potentially on top of a different commit) with `git stash apply`. Calling `git stash` without any arguments is equivalent to `git stash push`. A stash is by default listed as "WIP on **branchname** â€¦â€‹", but you can give a more descriptive message on the command line when you create one.\
\
The latest stash you created is stored in `refs/stash`; older stashes are found in the reflog of this reference and can be named using the usual reflog syntax (e.g. `stash@{0}` is the most recently created stash, `stash@{1}` is the one before it, `stash@{2.hours.ago}` is also possible). Stashes may also be referenced by specifying just the stash index (e.g. the integer `n` is equivalent to `stash@{n}`).

#### **Example**
We are currently in the main branch of some repo and there are changes in index.html we want to stash away. After that we will restore them in another branch.

We take a look at the current status:
```
$ git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   index.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
Since we want to stash our changes, we run the following:
```
$ git stash
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: fdade05 Initial commit
```
If we take a look at our stash, we can find our entry:
```
$ git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on main: fdade05 Initial commit
```
Now we checkout to another branch, where we will restore our stashed changes later. For reference see [`git checkout`](#git-checkout). We take a look at our status:
```
$ git status
On branch git-stash-example
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
We see that there are no changed files. Now we proceed to restore our changes we stashed earlier:
```
$ git stash apply
On branch git-stash-example
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   index.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
As we can see, we directly get a status on the changes we applied. We successfully brought over the changes from the main branch to another one using `git stash`. Awesome! :partying_face:

### `git tag`
#### **Description**
Manage tags which are usually used to label the finishing commit for a release version.

From the [official documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag):

> Add a tag reference in `refs/tags/`, unless `-d/-l/-v` is given to delete, list or verify tags.\
\
Unless `-f` is given, the named tag must not yet exist.\
\
If one of `-a`, `-s`, or `-u <keyid>` is passed, the command creates a **tag** object, and requires a tag message. Unless `-m <msg>` or `-F <file>` is given, an editor is started for the user to type in the tag message.\
\
If `-m <msg`> or `-F <file>` is given and `-a`, `-s`, and `-u <keyid>` are absent, `-a` is implied.\
\
Otherwise, a tag reference that points directly at the given object (i.e., a lightweight tag) is created.\
\
A GnuPG signed tag object will be created when `-s` or `-u <keyid>` is used. When `-u <keyid>` is not used, the committer identity for the current user is used to find the GnuPG key for signing. The configuration variable `gpg.program` is used to specify custom GnuPG binary.\
\
Tag objects (created with `-a`, `-s`, or `-u`) are called "annotated" tags; they contain a creation date, the tagger name and e-mail, a tagging message, and an optional GnuPG signature. Whereas a "lightweight" tag is simply a name for an object (usually a commit object).\
\
Annotated tags are meant for release while lightweight tags are meant for private or temporary object labels. For this reason, some git commands for naming objects (like `git describe`) will ignore lightweight tags by default.

#### **Common usage**
Create a tag named `<tag name>` locally:
```
git tag <tag name>
```
Note: The tag is created from the current branch and only includes commited changes. See [`git checkout`](#git-checkout) for more information on selecting the branch.

Delete a tag named `<tag name>` locally:
```
git tag -d <tag name>
```

Push tags to the remote:
```
git push --tags
```

Push a tag named `<tag name>` to the `origin` remote:
```
git push origin <tag name>
```

For more information on deleting tags from the remote, see Further Reading below.
